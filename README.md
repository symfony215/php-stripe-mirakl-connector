# How to start a development environment using docker

`docker-compose` starts 3 containers:

* `db`: This is the PostreSQL database container (can be changed to postgresql or whatever you prefer in the `docker-compose.yml` file),
* `php`: This is the PHP container including the application volume mounted on. It uses supervisord to start PHP, the required workers and cron.
* `nginx`: This is the Nginx webserver container exposing the application.

This results in the following running containers:

```bash
> $ docker-compose ps
          Name                        Command               State                          Ports
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
mirakl-stripe_db_1         docker-entrypoint.sh postgres    Up      5432/tcp
mirakl-stripe_nginx_1      nginx -g daemon off;             Up      0.0.0.0:443->443/tcp, 0.0.0.0:80->80/tcp
mirakl-stripe_php_1        docker-php-entrypoint /usr ...   Up      9000/tcp, 0.0.0.0:9001->9001/tcp
```

# Read logs

All application logs in the Docker containers are redirected to `stdout` and `stderr`, meaning you can access Symfony application logs by running `docker-compose logs php`.
